# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on the Enochian Translator component, which is the core feature of the application. We've recently implemented a negation handling system to improve translation accuracy, particularly for words with negation prefixes like "im-", "un-", "non-", etc.

## Recent Changes

Based on the code examination and recent development work:

- Added a negation handling system for the translator that:

  - Correctly handles words with common negation prefixes (im-, un-, non-, dis-, etc.)
  - Uses the Enochian "OL-" prefix to negate translated words
  - Prevents incorrect partial matches (e.g., "immortal" no longer matches with "mortal")
  - Properly preserves semantics of negated terms

- Enhanced the EnochianTranslator component with the following features:
  - Text input area for English words/phrases
  - Translation button with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter)
  - Display of translations in three formats:
    - Original Enochian words
    - Phonetic pronunciation
    - Enochian symbols
  - Statistics about translation matches (direct, partial, missing)
  - Root analysis for the first word in the translation
  - Copy functionality for all translation formats

## Active Decisions

1. **Translation Approach**:

   - Dictionary lookups with fallbacks to partial matches
   - Specialized handling for negation prefixes using the Enochian "OL-" prefix
   - Intelligent matching that respects word semantics

2. **UI Organization**: The UI is organized into cards for input and output sections
3. **Data Fetching**: React Query is used to load the Enochian dictionary and root data
4. **Display Modes**: Three display modes are supported (words, phonetic, symbols)

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the project may include:

1. Further refinement of negation handling for edge cases
2. Handling of other word transformations (comparative forms, tenses, etc.)
3. Expanding the Enochian dictionary for more comprehensive translations
4. Adding more detailed root analysis for all words in the translation
5. Implementing a reverse translation feature (Enochian to English)
6. Adding pronunciation guides or audio samples
7. Creating a more comprehensive educational section about Enochian
8. Implementing user accounts for saving translations

## Key Considerations

1. **Semantic Correctness**: Ensuring translations preserve the intended meaning, especially for words with negation
2. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring translations are accurate according to available Enochian sources
3. **Performance**: Optimizing translation for larger texts
4. **Accessibility**: Making the UI accessible to users with different abilities
5. **Mobile Experience**: Ensuring the application works well on mobile devices
