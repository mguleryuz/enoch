## In Progress

🔄 **Dictionary Data**

- May need expansion for better translation coverage

🔄 **Root Analysis**

- Currently limited to the first word of a translation
- Could be expanded to handle all translated words

## Not Yet Implemented

❌ **Reverse Translation**

❌ **Educational Content**

- Limited educational materials about Enochian
- Could add more comprehensive learning resources

❌ **Advanced Features**

## Current Status

The application has a functional core translation feature with a clean user interface. The main functionality works, but there are opportunities for expansion in terms of both features and content. The system successfully fetches and uses the Enochian dictionary and root data, providing a foundation for further development.
