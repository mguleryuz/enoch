# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus appears to be on the Enochian Translator component, which is the core feature of the application. This component provides the interface for translating English text to Enochian and displaying the results in various formats.

## Recent Changes

Based on the code examination, the EnochianTranslator component has been implemented with the following features:

- Text input area for English words/phrases
- Translation button with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter)
- Display of translations in three formats:
  - Original Enochian words
  - Phonetic pronunciation
  - Enochian symbols
- Statistics about translation matches (direct, partial, missing)
- Root analysis for the first word in the translation
- Copy functionality for all translation formats

## Active Decisions

1. **Translation Approach**: The current approach uses dictionary lookups with fallbacks to partial matches
2. **UI Organization**: The UI is organized into cards for input and output sections
3. **Data Fetching**: React Query is used to load the Enochian dictionary and root data
4. **Display Modes**: Three display modes are supported (words, phonetic, symbols)

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for the project may include:

1. Expanding the Enochian dictionary for more comprehensive translations
2. Adding more detailed root analysis for all words in the translation
3. Implementing a reverse translation feature (Enochian to English)
4. Adding pronunciation guides or audio samples
5. Creating a more comprehensive educational section about Enochian
6. Implementing user accounts for saving translations

## Key Considerations

1. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring translations are accurate according to available Enochian sources
2. **Performance**: Optimizing translation for larger texts
3. **Accessibility**: Making the UI accessible to users with different abilities
4. **Mobile Experience**: Ensuring the application works well on mobile devices
