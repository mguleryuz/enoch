## What Works

‚úÖ **Core Translation Engine**

- English to Enochian dictionary lookup system
- Handling of direct matches, partial matches, and missing translations
- Marking untranslated words with brackets
- **Basic Translation**: The core translation engine can convert English text to Enochian using the provided dictionary.
- **Multiple Display Formats**: Translations can be displayed as Enochian words, phonetic pronunciations, and symbolic representations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: The system provides statistics on translation matches (direct, partial, missing, constructed).
- **Root Analysis**: The system can analyze Enochian words to show their root components and meanings.
- **Negation Handling**: The translator now properly handles words with negation prefixes (im-, un-, non-, etc.) using the Enochian "OL-" prefix, preventing incorrect semantic matches.

‚úÖ **Display Systems**

- Original Enochian word display
- Phonetic pronunciation using Enochian letter names
- Symbol representation of Enochian letters

‚úÖ **User Interface**

- Input area with translation button
- Display area with tabs for different formats
- Copy functionality for translations
- Clean, card-based layout
- Loading states for dictionary data
- Error handling for data loading failures

‚úÖ **Additional Features**

- Translation statistics (direct/partial/missing matches)
- Root analysis for the first word in a translation
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter) for translation

## In Progress

üîÑ **Dictionary Data**

- The completeness of the Enochian lexicon is unknown
- May need expansion for better translation coverage

üîÑ **Root Analysis**

- Currently limited to the first word of a translation
- Could be expanded to handle all translated words

## Not Yet Implemented

‚ùå **Reverse Translation**

- No Enochian to English translation capability yet

‚ùå **Educational Content**

- Limited educational materials about Enochian
- Could add more comprehensive learning resources

‚ùå **Advanced Features**

- No user accounts or saved translations
- No pronunciation audio
- No export functionality for translations

## Known Issues

- Unknown completeness of Enochian dictionary data
- Limited feedback on why some words cannot be translated
- Root analysis limited to first word only
- No validation against historical Enochian sources

## Current Status

The application has a functional core translation feature with a clean user interface. The main functionality works, but there are opportunities for expansion in terms of both features and content. The system successfully fetches and uses the Enochian dictionary and root data, providing a foundation for further development. Recent improvements have enhanced semantic accuracy, particularly for negated terms. The UI is clean and intuitive, with proper handling of different translation formats. Test coverage has been expanded to include the new negation handling functionality.
