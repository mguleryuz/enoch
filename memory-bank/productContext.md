# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Enochian language, attributed to the 16th-century occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley, is a complex mystical language system that remains relatively inaccessible to modern practitioners and scholars. Traditional resources for understanding and working with Enochian are often:

- Scattered across multiple obscure texts
